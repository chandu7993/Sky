    <p style="columns:5; text-decoration:none;">	Vietnamese EV maker VinFast today has officially announced its participation at the upcoming Auto Expo 2025. The brand has sent out a teaser which hints at two e-SUVs that will be seen at India’s largest motor show – the VF 7 and the VF 9. Read on to know what to expect from the VinFast VF 7 and VF 9.
	A Hyundai Tucson-sized 5-seat e-SUV, the VF 7 features an almost swoopy, crossover-like silhouette, sporting light units at the front and rear that form VinFast’s V motifs. In markets abroad, there are two trims available – Eco and Plus. While both are powered by a 75.3kWh (net) battery pack, the Eco has a single front motor making 204hp and 310Nm of torque; the Plus gets a dual motor setup that produces a combined 354hp and 500Nm.
